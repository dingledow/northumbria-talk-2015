# David Ingledow
## Lead Designer at SoPost

### Introduction — Slide 2-3

The aim of the talk is to give an overview of the projects and interests I had by the time I graduated from Interactive Media Design in 2013. The talk also covers what options were available to me at the time and the requirements of employers in the design and tech startup industry.

Also covered, will be a brief explanation of what we do at SoPost, as well as what opportunities there are for Designers in the tech startup community (specifically in Newcastle) and how to get involved.

### Interests After Graduating — Slide 4

Technology has historically originated from an engineering discipline. It has become a massive part of our lives – computer systems occupy our world, but humans are physical and social. I was consistently interested in how technology and data can be designed more meaningfully to create [Embodied Interaction](http://www.dourish.com/embodied/embodied99.pdf). How can we make use of technology and the design process to create things that have a human benefit, whether that is a service, app or a design that is experiential?

### Revel — Slide 5-6

Collaborating with [Ryan Coupe](http://ryancoupe.co.uk) and [Luke Emmerson](http://lukeemmerson.co.uk), the aim of the brief was around healthy eating. Revel was an app and service that promoted people to take and share photos of their packed lunch with their friends. This played on the [food porn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_porn) phenomena and used achievements and real world rewards to promote the use of the service. The end goal of this was to make people eat healthier, educate them about cooking their own food and also reducing their living costs.

### Nudge – Microsoft — Slide 7

This project was conducted in collaboration with team members from other disciplines (3D Design and Industrial Design). The brief was in collaboration with Microsoft.

The design was a photo frame that would visually distort photos of close friends and relations depending on the quality of the user’s communication with them. The concept would take from various data troves such as messaging applications, as well as the location of the people in question and the time spent together face to face. The aim was to raise questions about how despite people being better connected before, has technology made keeping in contact with close friends and relations more passive? The lesser the quality of the communication, the more the picture would become distorted. A user can pick the frame up to interact with it and communicate with person in question via the frame to remove the distortion. It visualises how technology can know more about our personal relationships than we would like to think.

### Final Project

#### Slide 8-9

I was very interested in the design of cities and how technology is used and can be developed to improve the lives of all citizens and inhabitants.

There has been lots of research around the notion of the smart city – a city where public services and a wealth of data is collected and fed back to citizens to improve their lives.

#### Slide 10

Apart from the ever increasing use of data to improve civic services such as transportation, safety and security (Rio de Janeiro is a great example), I found that a lot of systems in place to access data are delivered in a confusing, complicated top-down approach. Some data could only be accessed by those with access to technology. Some questions in my final project were to consider how we could democratise data to those poorest in society and how we could engage all citizens and provide them with a sense of place – the focus should be more on smart citizens rather than a monolithic smart city.

#### Slide 11-13

A great example of a design that engaged people with their neighbourhood is the [I Wish This Was](http://candychang.com/i-wish-this-was/) project. It’s a really low-tech design that gets people to write on stickers what they want rundown and abandoned buildings to become. Another great example of ways in which technology can be accessible to any citizen is [Nordkapp’s Smart City Interface](https://vimeo.com/26030147). This is a high tech way to create a sense of place through knowledge of the urban environment.

#### Slide 14-18

I was heavily inspired by projects like this, but wanted to make the most of the opportunity to explore interesting and different methods of interaction, but for similar aims as the projects mentioned above.

I created a sensitive interface from silicone, alongside a Kinect and a projector, creating an interface for the city. The content was taken from sounds of the city – environment, speech and language. Notable inspiration came from work by [Micahel Banibila](https://vimeo.com/65413044) and [Scanner](https://vimeo.com/1343595). It allowed the users to feel connected with their city in a physical way. Further development of this project, I would like to have explored how the interface could feedback in other ways other than depth pressure, imagery and sound. It would have been interesting to see how motors could be used to distort the texture of the silicone to create other ways of visualising and sensing data from the city. [MIT’s inFORM project](http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/inform/) is an interesting example of how a tangible interface can change appearance to present data in interesting ways.

### Employability – Slides 19-21

These kinds of experiential design projects are often not obviously commercially viable. It can often be a concern how these projects will work when applying for a career in the design industry. For any design job, these experiential projects demonstrate a good understanding of design in a wider context. Being able to show how you developed an idea and the process behind it are vitally important points to communicate in your portfolio. Remember, explaining your approach to your role in group projects is just as important as your personal projects, since you’ll be working as part of a team in industry.

Demonstrating that you can empathise with your users needs should be clear from your work. Always defend the user and be prepared to always answer the question ‘why’ for any claims that your project makes.

### Experience – Slides 22-25

During my time at university, I worked as a Design Intern at [Komodo](http://www.komododigital.co.uk). I was involved in work for ITV, Sunderland College, Northumbria Police, NE1 and Newcastle Science City.

At the time of graduation, I was left with two options:

1. Work at an Agency, or;
2. Work at SoPost – a tech startup.

Both were Design roles, but both were very different routes. I chose to go down the startup route because it offered me more ownership over the design of a product. I would be a key member of an organisation that would iterate and develop a product to build a successful business.

### About SoPost – Slides 26-38

The initial objective for SoPost was to make the postal address dynamic and social.

> “An address should be where you are, or where you want things to be sent, rather than the last postcode somebody has for you,”

> “SoPost is about turning the things that we know and that rarely change – like our social IDs and email addresses – into our physical locations, creating almost a proxy for postal addresses in the process.”

Framing that problem as a service was hard – the benefits weren’t immediately obvious to the consumer.

To start creating a ‘proxy for postal addresses’ we developed a product that would allow people to use their social IDs as a method of verifying orders to receive free samples of products. This led to a new aim for SoPost: to do product sampling better than before.

Product sampling has traditionally been conducted by handing out free samples in public spaces or attaching them to the front of magazines. This typically generated an 8% return on investment. However, there’s no way of tracking which products end up in the hands of which consumers.

A brand will promote a SoPost campaign for their product, telling their current advocates that they can send a free sample of a product to their friends. The advocate’s friends can claim the gift that they receive and the product sample is delivered to them.

The aim for us is to bridge the gap between online and physical experiences that people have with brands.

A lot of the design work at SoPost has been to define a brand with clear documentation and guidelines. Mapping out and iterating the UX of a product is constantly in development. Laying the groundwork for a strong design process has been vital and will continue to be as we scale the business. Focussing on microinteractions at every level of the product, and defining this within the wider design guidelines has been essential.

### Startups in Newcastle

During my time at university, I heard very little about startups in Newcastle. Designers are the people with ideas – why not turn what you’re passionate about in to a business? It’s possible with the help of the community driven a lot by [Ignite](http://ignite.io) at Campus North.

Ignite run an accelerator programme. This means that you can apply to develop your idea under the guidance of mentors and turn it in to a successful business, with the possibility of receive investment.

50 startups have gone through Ignite’s programme and have [mentors](http://ignite.io/accelerator/#mentors) from Spotify, Stripe, Friends Reunited, and many more!

When applying to enter in to the programme, they’re not afraid of crazy ideas – they don’t want someone who wants to effectively redesign Foursquare.

89% of all startups that have been through the programme have gone on to receive initial investment. This means that, across the years, there’s been over £10 million invested in these companies.

Ignite alumni are more likely to raise more investment than any other, meaning it beats London to be the #1 accelerator in the UK by this measure.

To get involved in the community, why not head down to a [Startup Beers event](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/lyndsey-britton-ignite100-2835889232?s=29886845) – there’s always people looking for designers!
